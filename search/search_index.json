It uses standardized shapes and arrows to visually depict a sequence of actions or decisions. Kanban board A visual project management tool that uses columns and cards to represent tasks and their progress through different stages, helping teams manage workflow efficiently. Mind map A diagram used to visually organize information, where ideas branch out from a central concept, helping with brainstorming, planning, and understanding complex topics. Shape library A collection of predefined shapes available for use in creating diagrams. These can be categorized into general shapes, flowcharts, or other specific categories. Waypoint A point along the path of a connector that can be moved to adjust the connector\u2019s route. UML diagram Stands for Unified Modeling Language diagram.
