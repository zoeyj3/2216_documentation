    - Click and drag your mouse to create a selection box around the shapes you want to group.
    - Hold the Shift key and click on each shape individually to select multiple shapes.

2. Once the desired shapes are selected, do one of the following:

    - Right-click on any of the selected shapes and choose Group from the context menu.
    - Press Ctrl + G (Windows/Linux) or Cmd + G (Mac) to group the shapes.

3. Ungroup the shapes (if necessary): Right-click on the grouped shapes and choose Ungroup.
