## Style a Shape



## Style a Connector

### Set a floating connector

Floating connectors: These move around the perimeter of your shape as you move it around the drawing canvas, or change the route that the connector takes.

### Set a fixed connector

Fixed connectors: These stay attached to a fixed point on your shape, even when you move the shape around the drawing canvas.
